An application that I built as part of a team for the Software Engineering course at my university.

Workflow of the application:

<ul>
  <li><b>User registers/logs in to the system</b></li>
  <li><b>Logged-in users can browse available scooters for rent</b></li>
  <li><b>Logged-in users can add their scooters for rent</b></li>
  <li><b>Logged-in users can communicate with each other using real-time chat</b></li>
  <li><b>After the rental period, users can rate each other</b></li>
</ul>
